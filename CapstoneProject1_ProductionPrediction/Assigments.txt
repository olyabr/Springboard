#1 ML: Build an ML model to predict ‘cum_oil_365’ from 'prod-by-operated-day.csv’ 
using data in ‘completion.csv’ and 'well-index.csv’. Measure error using RMSE.

#2 Data Engineering: Time series transformation to convert 'monthly-production.csv’ 
into 'prod-by-operated-day.csv’.

linear regression
SVM
decision trees
random forest
gradient boosting

1. numeric features (scale the values for linear models like linear regression or SVM but keep as is for other complex models)
2. Categorical features (if nominal use dummy variables or one hot encoding, if ordinal convert to numbers)
3. for date time etc (you can extract year, month, day etc as separate columns and use them with other features OR use time series modeling - kind of more complex)
For modeling
1. First build models with all features and then perform feature selection
2. For feature selection - start by dropping features which you dont think matters from a domain perspective and recheck performance by rebuilding model
3. Other feature selection methods include using feature importance from models like random forest or using coefficients of linear regression to take features which are more imp
